This assignment was definitely challenging, as it took a lot of external learning in order to make my game playable. I used chatGPT throughout the creation of my game in order to ask questions and troubleshoot my code along the way. 

Because of the mechanical difficulties in constructing my game, I really wanted to focus on the narrative element of it. The premise is that, after recently turning 28, I have been an adult officially for 10 years, and within those 10 years I have lived in 3 different cities, and had different "versions" of life within periods of those years. To reflect this, I ideated game play that would be representative of life at those various points.

To navigate the game, you have to click through letters A-J. They go in alphabetical order from A-J. In my first game section, the crosswords reflect the period of my life when I was an undergad student studying English in Chicago. The crossword words contain a brief tale of my life at the time.

The next section is the maze section, which is supposed to be reprsentative of a hike in LA. There are different collision points which if you interact with them another little story will pop up, to tell about my life at that time. 

In the final section, the story is part of the background, and it is a very chill game wherein you can draw on a latte in a cup. I like this as the ending because it is definitely representative of where I am now in life, not just literally but also metaphorically, where I take life in stride. 

In terms of the code itself, I found that the collision function was the most challenging to understand, but ultimately the most useful in terms of "gamification". Also, the different variations of draw function took me a while to figure out (especially when it comes to painting on top of an image); yet once I was able to figure that out it was very fun to implement!
